1. **KeyError: 'evidence_quality'** 
   - **Location**: `enhanced_theme_analysis_tool.py` line ~1261 in `_discover_themes` method
   - **Cause**: `_calculate_cultural_enhanced_confidence` didn't return `evidence_quality` key that downstream code expected
   - **Impact**: Cultural intelligence processing crashed, preventing all theme generation
   - **Fix**: Added compatibility key mapping: `components["evidence_quality"] = components.get("authority_score", 0.0)`

2. **KeyError: 'local_relevance'**
   - **Location**: `enhanced_theme_analysis_tool.py` line ~1261 in confidence bonus calculation  
   - **Cause**: "practical" processing type in `_calculate_cultural_enhanced_confidence` didn't include `local_relevance` key
   - **Impact**: Theme discovery crashed when accessing `confidence_components["local_relevance"]`
   - **Fix**: Added `local_relevance` to practical processing type components

#### **✅ Testing Anti-Pattern Fixed**

**Wrong Layer (Previous)**: Testing CONSUMERS of themes
- Scripts like `analyze_themes.py`, `compare_destinations.py`
- Already-processed theme data from database
- Cultural intelligence features on existing data

**Correct Layer (Now)**: Testing PRODUCERS of themes  
- Tools like `enhanced_theme_analysis_tool.py`
- Theme GENERATION process during discovery
- Confidence calculation where bugs actually occurred

#### **🎯 How New Tests Catch These Bugs**

**Multiple Tests Now Validate**:
- `test_calculate_cultural_enhanced_confidence_returns_required_keys()` - **Directly catches KeyError: 'evidence_quality'**  
- `test_theme_discovery_with_cultural_intelligence()` - **Catches KeyError: 'local_relevance' in end-to-end flow**
- `test_keyerror_in_confidence_calculation()` - **Specific exception handling for both KeyErrors**
- `test_confidence_calculation_compatibility()` - **Validates key compatibility between confidence methods**

## 🧠 **Semantic Priority Data Extraction**

### **How It Works**

The semantic extraction system uses advanced LLM analysis to understand travel content:

#### **Context Awareness**
```
Traditional Regex: "$35" → Always extracted as generic cost
Semantic System:   "$35 visa fee" → Accessibility cost
                  "$35 per meal" → Meal cost average  
                  "$35 hotel rate" → Accommodation cost
```

#### **Natural Language Understanding**
```
Content: "The area is remarkably secure with excellent tourist assistance"
Regex:   Misses "secure" (not exact match for "safe")
Semantic: ✅ Safety rating: High, Tourist police: Available
```

#### **Synonym Recognition**
```
Various Terms → Unified Understanding:
"tourist police" = "tourism officers" = "tourist assistance officers"
"travel advisory" = "safety warning" = "government alert"
"visa on arrival" = "arrival visa" = "VOA"
```

### **Extraction Categories**

#### **🛡️ Safety Metrics**
- **Crime indices and safety ratings**
- **Tourist police availability**
- **Emergency contact numbers**
- **Travel advisory levels**
- **Safe areas and areas to avoid**

#### **💰 Cost Indicators**
- **Daily budget ranges (low/mid/high)**
- **Meal and accommodation costs**
- **Transportation expenses**
- **Currency and exchange information**
- **Seasonal price variations**

#### **🏥 Health Requirements**
- **Required vs recommended vaccinations**
- **Health risks and disease information**
- **Water and food safety**
- **Medical facility quality**
- **Health insurance requirements**

#### **🛂 Accessibility Information**
- **Visa requirements and costs**
- **Direct flight connections**
- **English proficiency levels**
- **Infrastructure quality ratings**
- **Average flight times**

### **Quality Metrics**

Each extraction includes comprehensive quality assessment:

- **Extraction Confidence** (0-1): Overall reliability of extracted data
- **Data Completeness** (0-1): Percentage of fields successfully populated  
- **Source Credibility** (0-1): Authority level of information source
- **Temporal Relevance** (0-1): Freshness and currency of information

### **Fallback Mode**

When LLM is unavailable, the system:
- ✅ Continues operation with basic structure
- ✅ Maintains data integrity and format consistency
- ✅ Provides clear indication of extraction method
- ✅ Logs appropriate warnings without crashing

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **✅ Recently Fixed Critical Issues** *(June 2025)*

The following critical stability issues have been **RESOLVED**:

#### **❌ DateTime Arithmetic Crash (FIXED)**
**Previous Symptom**: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.datetime' and 'str'`
**Impact**: ContradictionDetectionAgent crashed, causing 1454 validated themes → 0 stored themes
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Comprehensive datetime compatibility in evidence_hierarchy.py, confidence_scoring.py, specialized_agents.py

#### **❌ None Value AttributeError Crashes (FIXED)**
**Previous Symptom**: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'` in theme processing
**Impact**: Theme analysis pipeline crashed on None content values  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Robust None handling in insight_classifier.py, seasonal_intelligence.py, enhanced_theme_analysis_tool.py

#### **❌ ConfidenceBreakdown Missing Parameters (FIXED)**
**Previous Symptom**: Missing 'factors' parameter during confidence scoring initialization
**Impact**: Theme confidence calculation failed completely
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Complete parameter validation in confidence_scoring.py

#### **❌ Theme Object vs Dictionary Incompatibility (FIXED)**
**Previous Symptom**: `argument of type 'Theme' is not iterable` in tests and processing
**Impact**: Inconsistent handling between Theme objects and dictionary formats
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Seamless compatibility in enhanced_data_models.py and test suites

### **System Health Verification**
Run these commands to verify the fixes:
```bash
# Critical test validation (should all pass)

**5. Low confidence scores**: Check if enough credible sources are available and evidence diversity
**6. Missing enhanced attributes**: Ensure enhanced analysis is enabled in config.yaml
**7. Classification errors**: Review destination data (population, admin levels) and classification thresholds
**8. Seasonal analysis issues**: Verify seasonal content is present and seasonal intelligence is enabled

#### **🗄️ Cache Issues**

**9. Slow performance**: Check cache hit rates and disk space
**10. Corruption errors**: Cache system auto-recovers; check logs for details
**11. Memory usage**: ChromaDB uses ~31MB; file cache ~3MB typically

### **Debugging Tools**

#### **Semantic Extraction Diagnostics**
```bash
# Test semantic extraction directly
python -c "
from src.tools.priority_data_extraction_tool import PriorityDataExtractor
extractor = PriorityDataExtractor()
test_content = 'Bangkok is generally safe. Budget travelers: \$25 per day. Visa required \$35.'
result = extractor.extract_all_priority_data(test_content)
print('Extraction method:', result.get('extraction_method'))
print('Confidence:', result.get('extraction_confidence'))
print('Safety data:', bool(result.get('safety', {}).get('crime_index')))
"

# Check LLM availability
python -c "
from src.core.llm_factory import LLMFactory
from src.config_loader import load_app_config
config = load_app_config()
providers = LLMFactory.get_available_providers(config)
print('Available providers:', providers)
"
```

#### **General System Diagnostics**
```bash
# Check database schema
python -c "import sqlite3; conn=sqlite3.connect('enhanced_destination_intelligence.db'); print([x[0] for x in conn.execute('SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\"table\"').fetchall()])"

# Validate complete test suite
python tests/run_all_tests.py

# Quick validation
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_priority_data_extraction_tool.py -v

# Check configuration
python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('config.yaml')))"
```

#### **Cache Diagnostics**
```bash
# Cache health check
python -c "
from src.caching import read_from_cache, write_to_cache
test_data = {'test': 'cache_check'}
write_to_cache(['diagnostic', 'test'], test_data)
result = read_from_cache(['diagnostic', 'test'], 1)
print('✅ Cache working' if result == test_data else '❌ Cache issue')
"
```

### **Performance Optimization**

#### **For Large-Scale Processing**
1. **Increase cache retention**: Extend expiry days in config.yaml
2. **Batch processing**: Process multiple destinations in sequence
3. **LLM quota management**: Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting
4. **Memory optimization**: Clear ChromaDB periodically for large datasets

#### **For Development**
1. **Use fallback mode**: Disable LLM for faster testing
2. **Reduce processing scope**: Limit max_urls_per_destination
3. **Cache warming**: Run with same destinations to build cache

### **Logging and Monitoring**

#### **Log Files**
- **Main Application**: `logs/enhanced_app_run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- **LangChain Agents**: `logs/enhanced_langchain_agent_trace_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- **Console Output**: Real-time progress and status updates

#### **Key Log Messages**
```
✅ Semantic priority extractor initialized with configured LLM
⚠️  Failed to initialize semantic extractor, using default (fallback mode)
📊 Semantic extraction completed for [URL]: confidence=0.87, completeness=0.92
🚨 Semantic extraction failed: [error] (falls back gracefully)
```

## 🔧 **Cache Management**

### **Cache Directory Structure**
```
cache/                              # File-based cache (2.79 MB, 83 files)
├── [md5_hash].json                # Individual cache files
└── ...

chroma_db/                          # Vector database cache (31.50 MB, 6 files)

python -c "
import os
cache_files = len([f for f in os.listdir('cache') if f.endswith('.json')])
cache_size = sum(os.path.getsize(os.path.join('cache', f)) for f in os.listdir('cache'))
print(f'Cache files: {cache_files}, Size: {cache_size/(1024*1024):.2f} MB')
"

# Clear cache (if needed)
rm -rf cache/*  # Clear file cache
rm -rf chroma_db/*  # Clear vector cache (caution: rebuilds embeddings)

# Verify cache performance
python tests/performance/test_cache_performance.py --comprehensive
```

```
destination_insights/
└── consolidated/
    └── destination_name_YYYY-MM-DD.json  # Single comprehensive file
```

### Consolidated Export Format
Each export contains:
- **Evidence Registry**: Single source of truth for all evidence
- **Reference-Based Themes**: Themes reference evidence by ID (no duplication)
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: All analysis data in one place
- **Pre-computed Views**: Fast access to common data patterns

### Benefits
- **70-80% smaller** file sizes compared to legacy multi-file exports
- **Zero data duplication** across data structures
- **Faster processing** with single file I/O operations
